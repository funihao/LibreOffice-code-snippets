Code snippets for LibreOffice Basic that are hard to find elsewhere

While there are many Basic macro examples for other proprietary office solutions it is somewhat harder to find good examples for LibreOffice / OpenOffice Basic. While language constructs are very similar, the API to deal with spreadsheets and text documents is completely different. As sources on how to do things in LibreOffice Basic seem to be scarce it is much harder to find good examples of how to do things in Calc spreadsheets and Writer documents. 

The code snippets in this Github archive contain solutions for some things for which I had a hard time finding examples on the net and combining them with information contained in the API documentation.

In the hope that your favorite search engine will point you to these examples I put them on Github so you will hopefully spend less time on doing seemingly simple things.
